GCode Plotter
=============

This is a program that takes GCode (CNC Machine code) and allows you to edit the traces and reoder them

It's been specifically crafted to take the output of the Inkscape GCode exporter and rework those lines

Sometime i'll update this and add in links and maybe even a tutorial
