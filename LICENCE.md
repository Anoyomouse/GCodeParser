If you want to commit changes, please submit a push request so that the changes may be merged into the main source tree.

Distribution of this code is NOT allowed on any site unless it has been specifically allowed, this way there is one official place to get the code, and only one place you can get bugs from, and I’m sure the quality of the code is good, I don’t like bad code, and I don’t like it when things break, so I want to make sure that everything I release will in fact do what I say it does, without anything malicious being put into it.

Should a modification be required that alters a significant portion of the code (enough to warrant a separate distribution of the code) please contact me, as we can negotiate either an alternative branch you can commit to and release from, or alternatives.

If a pull request is submitted,no copyright statement should be removed from the code.
